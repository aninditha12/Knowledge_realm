<p id="head" align="center"><b>About R Programming Language</b></p>

<p  id="cont">R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, show substantial increases in popularity in recent years. As of August 2018, R ranks 18th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.

A GNU package, source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran and R itself and is freely available under the GNU General Public License. Pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. Although R has a command line interface, there are several graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an Integrated development environment .<br/>     

R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and currently developed by the R Development Core Team (of which Chambers is a member). R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.<br/> 

R and its libraries implement a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others. R is easily extensible through functions and extensions, and the R community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages. Many of R's standard functions are written in R itself, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. 

Another strength of R is static graphics, which can produce publication-quality graphs, including mathematical symbols. Dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages.

R has Rd, its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both online in a number of formats and in hard copy.
R is an interpreted language; users typically access it through a command-line interpreter.</p>
